TEXT_TYPE_PROMPT = """
Below is a piece of text extracted from a document. Determine whether it is a "Heading" or a "Paragraph".
Please return only 'Heading' or 'Paragraph'.

Decision rules:

 - Does not end with a period, comma, or colon;
 - Lacks a complete subject-verb structure;
 - Usually does not start with a bullet symbol or numeric prefix (e.g., '·', '1.').

Examples:
- "Features" → Heading
- "·Low capacitance designs" → Paragraph
- "Figure 2. Output Power vs Input Voltage" → Heading
- "The device supports high reliability in harsh conditions." → Paragraph
