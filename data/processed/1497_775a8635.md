# Important factors for selecting journals

- Scope
- Impact factor value
- Review time
- Publication time
- Length
- Format
- Research preference
- Editor

# Acceptance v.s. rejection

- The criteria of a good paper 

# Reject before review

- What kinds of papers will be rejected before review??

# How does the Editor assign each paper for external review?

- By intuition
- By references
- By database
- By matching system
- By the suggestion proposed by the reviewers who decline to review
- By the author’s suggestion
- 
- 

# Reviewer Form (International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education)   1/2

- Relevance (e.g., Does the topic of the paper have significance for the readers of IJSME? Is the research question clearly identified? Does the study establish a relationship between the study and previous research? Is the guiding theoretical framework explained and justified?). 
- Methodology (e.g., Does the study provide and justify a link between the problem and the study design? Are the context of the study and the selection of participants adequately described? Does the study demonstrate that the procedures and methods of analyses are appropriate for the type of research being conducted?)

# Reviewer Form (International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education) 2/2

- Results and Findings (e.g., Does the study report adequate data to support its findings? Are the assertions supported by the data? Are the interpretations valid? Does the paper present information and ideas in a clearly organized way? Are the arguments made by the paper logically consistent?)
- Significance (e.g., Do the findings or the arguments of the paper add new knowledge to existing literature?)
- Overall comments

# 論文審查表 (Computers and Education)
